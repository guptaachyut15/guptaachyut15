### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  Welcome to my Github profile! As a backend developer proficient in Python, Node.Js SQL, GCS, AWS, Firebase, DSA, and other related technologies, I have honed my skills working in the field.

I have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as experience building scalable and efficient backend systems. My expertise in Python allows me to develop robust and maintainable code, while my proficiency in SQL ensures that data is properly organized and easy to access.

I have extensive experience working with cloud platforms such as GCS and AWS, as well as Firebase for real-time database management. I also have a strong foundation in DSA, which enables me to build efficient algorithms and data structures.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions that meet business objectives. I have a passion for learning and am always eager to explore new technologies and tools to improve my skills and knowledge.
